# The Spreadsheet Source Code

This is the source code for [The Spreadsheet](https://www.thespreadsheet.net) website. I have coded everything by myself, except the website which is hosted by Wix. Tableau also hosts the Tableau Public visualizations.

# What is The Spreadsheet?

I played hockey my whole life and in 2020 when the pandemic hit, I found a Xbox league that allowed myself and 5 other real people to play a virtual game of hockey against 6 other real people. I quickly became aware that the thousands of players in this league took it very seriously. It also became apparent that people judged success based solely on two stats; wins and points. Due to my analytical mindset, I knew there were better ways to judge performance. And this is what birthed The Spreadsheet.

Fast forward ~3 years and what started as a simple Google spreadsheet has turned into a full-blown website with over 500 monthly users. The Spreadsheet is a website that allows users to deeper analyze their performance in the virtual hockey league. I have created my own Wins Above Replacement models entirely from scratch, as well as a variety of other metrics that I believe are better indicators of performance than the traditional stats. I have also created a variety of visualizations that allow users to compare themselves to other players in the league.

The Spreadsheet has quickly become a recognizable brand among the community and I am very proud of what I have created. This project taught me more about data science and analytics than I could have ever imagined. I have also learned a lot about how to run a business (as I migrated to monthly subscriptions in early 2023). I am excited to see where this project goes in the future.
